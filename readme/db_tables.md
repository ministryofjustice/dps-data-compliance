## Database Tables 

The following diagram shows the intended structure of the database tables.

This obviously comes with the caveat that this is a static diagram and may well end up out of date.

To update the diagram, navigate to [draw.io](https://draw.io) and import the file 
`data_compliance_db_tables.drawio.svg`. Make sure that any changes are then re-exported back to this
file (`File > Export As > SVG...`) with the `Include a copy of my diagram` ticked to update the image
in this README with the diagram data embedded.

Please refer to SQL files at `../src/main/resources/db/migration` for current DDL.
