## Database Tables 

The following diagram shows the intended structure of the database tables.

This obviously comes with the caveat that this is a static diagram and may well end up out of date.

To update the diagram, navigate to [draw.io](https://draw.io) and import the file 
`data_compliance_db_tables.drawio`. Make sure that any changes are then saved back to this file
and the diagram is then re-exported as SVG to update the image in this README.

Please refer to SQL files at `../src/main/resources/db/migration` for current DDL.
